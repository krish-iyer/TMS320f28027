# TMS320f28027
Objective:
Project is to develop custom firmware on TMS320 and communicate with Arduino

Assets:
CCSTUDIO 5.5 
TMS320f28027 - piccolo F28027

Methodology:
1. Develop customised functions to do MAC operations in an optimized way.
2. To develop drivers for SPI communication with external devices.
3. To create Arduino libraries with which we can utilize the TMS320 for high speed computations/ background calculations.


Works Done:

1. Configured external interrupt - with GPIO input in C 
   Knowledge on Bitwise configurations in C, and interrupt vectors - Refer project 1
2. ASM function called by C program. - using Direct addressing mode
   Knowledge on rules of arguments passing from C to ASM and vice-versa - Refer project 2

Halfway:
1. Memory management - Only tested on RAM, program need to be flashed and then tested.
   Knowledge on creating command files - Refer project 3


Approaches that helped:
1. Bitwise configuration in C.
2. Using assembly functions to optimize the code.
